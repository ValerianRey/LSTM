    "The goal of this notebook is to check if we can learn a low dimensional LSTM to solve the parity problem on very long sequences. The problem is defined as follows: for a sequence of bits, is the number of 1s in the sequence even or odd? If it is even, the output should be 0, otherwise it should be 1. Note that with sequences of length 2, this is exactly the XOR problem."
